Okay so I've been using Emacs for a couple months now and have created a pretty intense configuration. Not that intense. Just...sort of all over the place. I use the GUI version of Emacs, so it is more tailored for that than the console version. I have some conditionals set up so that it is not completely useless on terminal, but it isn't comprehensive in any way, shape, or form.

[Here is my Emacs Configuration for inspection.](https://github.com/ssunday/emacs-config)

Some highlights:

* Company for autocompletion. Really nice and slick. The documentation and third party packages/integration is phenomenal.

* Counsel/Swiper/Ivy for commands, searching, and finding stuff. It took some time massaging to get working the way I wanted, but the end result is super nice and efficient.

* AG for finding something across multiple directories/files.

* Dumb-jump for finding function definitions.

* Clojure font locking so that functions/built-in methods are highlighted a color that compliments with the atom-one-dark theme I have.

* Neotree for file viewing

And more.

Yeah. I've spent far too long tweaking and messing with it, but it is in a highly usable state. Probably wouldn't make sense to most people but, yeah.
