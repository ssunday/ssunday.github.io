The Recordings are a series of shorts done in the spirit of [The Craftsman Articles](https://github.com/sensui/the-craftsman-book/tree/master/). They are set in the 'verse of The Adventures of the Trinity and the One, my science-fiction-fantasy series. Talk about shameless plugging...anyway. It is the chronicles of two Empirians, 'aliens' on Earth to learn the art of programming.

The two Empirians are:

**Lapadj** - A Kharatzara, or 'soul-eater,' who is cloaked (shape shifted) as the Human 'Harrison'. Supposedly engaged in his task.

**Sarela** - A Szarehan. Szarehan are comprised of energy and are generally intangible. Sarela has made herself invisible and is the one recording Lapadj's antics.

Other notable persons:

**Anna** - The Human who has found herself the mentor/partner of 'Harrison.' Optimistic and attempts to be humorous.

**The Spine** - The Network of the Empire. Contains all forms of data and information in its databases. Also is a giant computer that exists across space and time. The Spine is the narrator of the series. Although it has been set to a 'basic' narration of the recordings, it does not care and adds its own quips and opinions as befits something of the Empire.
