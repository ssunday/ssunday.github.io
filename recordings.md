The Recordings are a series of shorts done in the spirit of [The Craftsman Articles](https://github.com/sensui/the-craftsman-book/tree/master/). They are set in the 'verse of The Adventures of the Trinity and the One, my science-fiction-fantasy series. Talk about shameless plugging...anyway. It is the chronicles of two Empirians, 'aliens' on Earth to learn the art of programming.

The two Empirians are:

*Lapadj* - A Kharatzara, or 'soul-eater,' who is cloaked (shape shifted) as a Human.

*Sarela* - A Szarehan. Szarehan are comprised of energy and are generally intangible. Sarela has made herself invisible and is the one recording Lapadj's antics.

And [here they are](/recordings-posts/), in all their glory.
