The Recordings are a series of shorts done in the spirit of [The Craftsman Articles](https://github.com/sensui/the-craftsman-book/tree/master/). They are set in the 'verse of The Adventures of the Trinity and the One, my science-fiction-fantasy series. Talk about shameless self-plugging, at least I didn't outright link to it...anyway. These Recordings are the chronicles of two Empirians, 'aliens,' on Earth to learn the art of programming.

The two Empirians are:

**Lapadj** - A Kharatzara, or 'soul-eater,' who is cloaked (shape shifted) as the Human 'Harrison'. Supposedly engaged in his task. ![Lapadj](/assets/post-images/Lapadj.JPG)

**Sarela** - A Szarehan. Szarehan are comprised of energy and are generally intangible. Sarela has made herself invisible and is the one recording Lapadj's antics. She is only there for the entertainment value and something like loyalty to Lapadj. ![Sarela](/assets/post-images/Sarela.JPG)

Other notable persons:

**Anna** - The Human who has found herself as the mentor/partner of 'Harrison.' Optimistic and attempts to be humorous.

**The Spine** - The Network of the Empire. Contains all forms of data and information in its databases. Also is a giant computer that exists across space and time. The Spine is the narrator of the series. Although it has been set to a 'basic' narration of the recordings, it does not care and adds its own quips and opinions as befits something of the Empire.

Some terms/definitions:

**Touring** - Touring is when an Empirian goes to Earth, pretends to be Human, and takes in all the sights and sounds of the planet and culture. A slightly taboo hobby.

**Cloaks** - A device that allows an Empirian to basically become a Human. *Very* flexible.

**Tyra Kolaq'blegae** - The dimension that the Empire and Earth exists in. Means 'first dimension.' For those inside of it, sometimes just referred to as 'the universe', which should be differentiated from *the* universe that controls all reality of Buhukiea, the realm of Catasore, the creator of Tyra Kolaq'blegae and the other multitude of dimensions that comprise Buhukiea.

**Mechanicha** - A race of mechanical beings and former robots that have ascended and gained souls and are equal members of the Empire.

Assorted Tyra Tarkush Definitions:

*Aye* - Yes *Aye ky* is 'I'm with you on that'

*Bashl* - No

*Orak* - Gods/Goddesses. *Orak ha* means 'Gods above'

*Vehk* - Switching topics. End of that thought. Cut to the chase.

*Shi sho* - Do tell. Do explain.
