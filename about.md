Hello, I'm Sarah Sunday.

I'm a software apprentice. In addition, or well, the software bit is the addition in my view, but whatever, I am a writer. A self-published author and all that. [I write books.](http://www.thespineoftheempire.com/the-series/) [And I rant.](https://medium.com/@sarahasunday/map-of-my-writing-on-medium-96b79c611562#.9kz9g46o9)

This is a blog about programming. It was, anyway. It has kind of been hijacked by the [Recordings series.](/recordings/) It's a strange place. I like it much better now. The series is how I tolerate blogging about programming. Me, being, well, me, it has to do with the above book series. They may or may not contain programming knowledge and humor. I give no guarantees.
