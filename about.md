Hello!

My name is Sarah Sunday. I am a student apprentice at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/), among other things such as author, blogger, foodie, LEGO enthusiast, perpetual hard-core-casual fan of basically anything, and so on. All those other interests have their place, and this little blog is for programming and the art of coding.
