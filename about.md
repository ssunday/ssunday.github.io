Hello, I'm Sarah Sunday.

I'm a software apprentice. This is a blog containing musings and writings of a programming and technical nature. My journey through the land of computers and technology.

I'm also a writer...self-published author and all that. [I write books.](http://www.thespineoftheempire.com/the-series/) [And I rant.](https://medium.com/@sarahasunday/map-of-my-writing-on-medium-96b79c611562#.9kz9g46o9)

[The Recording Series](/recordings/) is basically how I tolerate blogging about programming. Me, being, well, me, it has to do with the above book series. They may or may not contain programming knowledge and humor.
